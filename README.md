# OpenBSD on demand mesh host

The final goal is to add a full configured, secure by default, encrypted mesh node to an existing network. 

It will replicate all the services on the network, and it can be deleted without loosing any data.

Especially focused above security in every ISO/OSI pile level. 

Applications are multiples, from bypass Spanish Movistar ECHELON, to create very secure not logged chat, to dynamic traditional services that will move from an host to another in a total transparent mode to the final user.

I'm an addicted of privacy and security and I'm very tired about the modern slavery network transmitted by weapons from the European elite. 

**Vatican and Aristocracy are totally guilty about the recent destroy of democracy.**
